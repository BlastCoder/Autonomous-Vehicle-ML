# Autonomous-Vehicle-ML
This repository consists of two main folders for autonomous vehicle racing

## SVM Folder
This folder consists of code which uses ML and Support Vector Machines to predict the midline of a racing track with cones placed to detect the boundary.

## PSO Folder
This folder consists of code which uses ML and Particle Swarm Optimization to find the fastest trajectory around the racetrack.
